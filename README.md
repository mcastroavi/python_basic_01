Core object types
In Python, there are several core object types that are fundamental to the language. These types are used to store and manipulate data.
1. Numbers
Integers: Whole numbers, such as 5, -3, and 42.

Floats: Decimal numbers, such as 3.14, -0.001, and 2.0.

Complex Numbers: Numbers with real and imaginary parts, such as 3+4j.

2. Strings
Immutable sequences of characters, such as "hello", 'Python', and "12345".

3. Lists
Mutable sequences of items, which can be of different types, such as [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'], and [1, 'a', 3.14].

4. Tuples
Immutable sequences of items, which can be of different types, such as (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c'), and (1, 'a', 3.14).

5. Dictionaries
Collections of key-value pairs, such as {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}, where keys are unique and can be of any immutable type.

6. Sets
Collections of unique items, such as {1, 2, 3} and {'a', 'b', 'c'}, which are unordered and mutable.

7. Boolean
Represents truth values True and False.

8. NoneType
Represents the absence of a value, with a single value None.
